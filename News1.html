		<p>The KPI Social Service together with the Mobile Brigade of the URCS organized a donor day at KPI. This donation will replenish the blood bank of the Kyiv City Blood Center and help save the lives of both wounded soldiers and civilian patients. <br> <br> 
		This time, about 50 people volunteered to donate blood, including students, faculty and staff of Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, as well as students of the National Academy of Sciences. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, the need for blood donors in Ukraine has increased significantly. And it is easy to join the donation and save someone's life if you are 18 years old and have no contraindications. <br> <br> 
		The next blood donation in KPI will take place in 2 months. So join us!</p>
